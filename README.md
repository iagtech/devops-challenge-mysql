# IAG Benefits, LLC Maintenane Container (iagllctech/devops-challenge-mysql-backend)

MySQL backend for IAG's devops challenge.

## Getting Started

This container provides a MySQL python backend used as part of IAG's devops interview process.  The container is to be paired with its [frontend container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iagllctech/devops-challenge-frontend).

The container provides a backend that listens on port 8000 and connects to a MySQL database (connection controlled via environment variables described below). If you wish to see the application, you can clone the repository, and run the docker-compose file located in the repositories root.

### Prerequisities
